Frontier MartialArts Wrestling (19972001) After W*ING closed, Punish and Crush joined Genichiro Tenryu's WAR promotion. It was in WAR that the two started going by their more famous names, Jado and Gedo. While in WAR, the two would get their big break as they formed an alliance with Hiromichi Fuyuki called Fuyuki-Gun and would dominate WAR Six Man Tag team Division for years to come.

After losing the title, the team took a break with Gedo winning the WAR International Junior Heavyweight Championship on two occasions as well becoming a runner up in New Japan's 1995 Super J-Cup. Pro Wrestling Noah (2016) By the summer of 1995, Jado, Gedo and Fuyuki reunited and on August 5, 1995, won the Six-Man Tag Team Title for the third time by defeating Tenryu, Hamaguchi and Kitahar,a but lost the title one month later on October 4 to Kitahara, Nobutaka Araya and Arashi. On March 22, 1996, they would win the title for a fourth time in a rematch. Two months later on May 26, 1996, they would lose the title to Yoji Anjo, Yoshihiro Takayama and Kenichi Yamamoto. A few weeks later on June 7, Jado, Gedo, and Fuyuki would win the title for a fifth and final time. After the title was vacated on June 19, the three entered a tournament to win them back, but lost in the finals. After failing to regain the title, Jado and Gedo left WAR at the end of 1996. Championships and accomplishments In 1997, Jado and Gedo followed Fuyuki (now known as Kodo Fuyuki) to Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) and spend most of their time in Fuyuki's Team No Respect stable. Wasting no time, the three won the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship on March 21, 1997, but after four months as champions the title was vacated in July 1997. After losing the title, Jado and Gedo would be unable to win anymore championships together for the next few years (though Gedo did win the WEW Tag Team Championship with Koji Nakagawa), during this time, the team also began wrestling for All Japan Pro Wrestling, most notably participating at All Japan's first Tokyo Dome show on May 1, 1998. References In 2000, Jado and Gedo returned to title glory as they won the vacated WEW World Tag Team Championship on July 14, 2000, but lost the title two weeks later on July 28 to Pro Wrestling Noah's Masao Inoue and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. A few months later, on September 21, 2000, they would win the WEW Hardcore Tag Team Championship in a three way ladder match, but would lose those title a few weeks later on October 10, 2000 to Supreme and Homeless Jimmy. Towards the end of their tenure, Jado and Gedo formed a stable with Masato Tanaka called The Complete Players, which won the Six Man Tag Team Championship. However ten days later, the group left FMW and were stripped of the title. Through FMW's working relationship with American promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), Jado and Gedo worked three matches for the promotion in March 2000. ExtRogue security software is a form of malicious software and internet fraud that misleads users into believing there is a virus on their computer and aims to convince them to pay for a fake malware removal tool that actually installs malware on their computer. It is a form of scareware that manipulates users through fear, and a form of ransomware. Rogue security software has been a serious security threat in desktop computing since 2008. An early example that gained infamy was SpySheriff and its clones, such as Nava Shield. Propagation Rogue security software mainly relies on social engineering (fraud) to defeat the security built into modern operating system and browser software and install itself onto victims' computers.  A website may, for example, display a fictitious warning dialog stating that someone's machine is infected with a computer virus, and encourage them through manipulation to install or purchase scareware in the belief that they are purchasing genuine antivirus software. Common infection vectors Most have a Trojan horse component, which users are misled into installing.  The Trojan may be disguised as: Black Hat SEO Some rogue security software, however, propagate onto users' computers as drive-by downloads which exploit security vulnerabilities in web browsers, PDF viewers, or email clients to install themselves without any manual interaction. Malvertising More recently, malware distributors have been utilizing SEO poisoning techniques by pushing infected URLs to the top of search engine results about recent news events. People looking for articles on such events on a search engine may encounter results that, upon being clicked, are instead redirected through a series of sites before arriving at a landing page that says that their machine is infected and pushes a download to a \"trial\" of the rogue program.  A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising. Spam campaigns Cold-calling has also become a vector for distribution of this type of malware, with callers often claiming to be from \"Microsoft Support\" or another legitimate organization. Operation Black Hat search engine optimization (SEO) is a technique used to trick search engines into displaying malicious URLs in search results. The malicious webpages are filled with popular keywords in order to achieve a higher ranking in the search results. When the end user searches the web, one of these infected webpages is returned. Usually the most popular keywords from services such as Google Trends are used to generate webpages via PHP scripts placed on the compromised website. These PHP scripts will then monitor for search engine crawlers and feed them with specially crafted webpages that are then listed in the search results. Then, when the user searches for their keyword or images and clicks on the malicious link, they will be redirected to the Rogue security software payload. Countermeasures Most websites usually employ third-party services for advertising on their webpages. If one of these advertising services is compromised, they may end up inadvertently infecting all of the websites using their service by advertising rogue security software. Private efforts Spam messages that include malicious attachments, links to binaries and drive-by download sites are another common mechanism for distributing rogue security software. Spam emails are often sent with content associated with typical day-to-day activities such as parcel deliveries, or taxation documents, designed to entice users to click on links or run attachments. When users succumb to these kinds of social engineering tricks they are quickly infected either directly via the attachment, or indirectly via a malicious website. This is known as a drive-by download. Usually in drive-by download attacks the malware is installed on the victim's machine without any interaction or awareness and occurs simply by visiting the website. Government efforts Once installed, the rogue security software may then attempt to entice the user into purchasing a service or additional software by: See also Developers of rogue security software may also entice people into purchasing their product by claiming to give a portion of their sales to a charitable cause. The rogue Green antivirus, for example, claims to donate $2 to an environmental care program for each sale made. Notes Some rogue security software overlaps in function with scareware by also: References Sanction by the FTC and the increasing effectiveness of anti-malware tools since 2006 have made it difficult for spyware and adware distribution networksalready complex to begin withto operate profitably.  Malware vendors have turned instead to the simpler, more profitable business model of rogue security software, which is targeted directly at users of desktop computers. Ext",
