argentinachile border it is part of a family of backarc volcanoes in patagonia which formed from processes involving the collision of the chile ridge with the peruchile trench it lies farther east than the austral volcanic zone the volcanic arc that makes up the andean volcanic belt at this latitude paliaike formed over sedimentary rock of magallanes basin a jurassicage basin starting from the late miocene as a consequence of regional tectonic events human geography the volcanic field consists of an older plateau basalt formation and younger volcanic centres in the form of pyroclastic cones scoria cones maars and associated lava flows there are approximately  vents in an area of  square kilometres  square miles the vents often form local alignments along lineaments or faults and there are a number of maars and other lakes both volcanic and nonvolcanic the volcanic field is noteworthy for the presence of large amounts of xenoliths in its rocks and because the maar potrok aike is located here where palaeoclimate data have been obtained the field was active starting from million years ago the latest eruptions occurred during the holocene as indicated by the burial of archaeological artifacts the laguna azul maar formed about years before present geography and structure humans have lived in the region for thousands of years and a number of archaeological sites such as the fell cave are located in the field presently parts of the volcanic field are protected areas in chile and argentina and the city of rio gallegos in argentina is within  kilometres mi of the volcanic field local the name paliaike comes from the tehuelche language where pale means hunger and aike means location originally it was the name of a farm estancia and was later applied to the volcanic field regional the paliaike volcanic field spans the border between argentina and chile northwest of the magellanes strait most of the field lies in argentina within the southernmost part of santa cruz province while the chilean part is in the commune of san gregorio chile the cities of rio gallegos argentina and punta arenas chile lie northeast and southwest of paliaike respectively unusually for argentine volcanoes paliaike volcanoes are close to urban areas since the closest vent is only  kilometres mi or  kilometres mi away from rio gallegos the vents are easily observed from the city the monte aymond border pass lies next to the volcanic field and argentine national route  passes through the paliaike volcanic field the border crossing paso integracin austral lies next to the volcanic field on the chilean side there are hiking trails geology the paliaike volcanic field covers a surface area of  square kilometres  square miles and extends over  kilometres mi from northwest to southeast it is formed by a plateau of lava flows that is up to  metres ft thick in its northwestern reach with an average relief of  metres ft this plateau is formed by tables containing depressions and lakes and whose margins are steepdipping slopes that accumulate blocks at their feet it includes remnants of individual volcanic centres and some volcanic necks situated in the westcentral part of the field may be the formerly underground components of noweroded volcanic edifices among these volcanic necks are the cuadrado domeyko gay and philippi hills which conspicuously stick out of the surrounding plains the volcanic rocks were emplaced atop tertiaryage sediments which were smoothened by glacial action the sediments are often unstable and prone to mass wasting and landslides composition there are  volcanic vents in the field monogenetic volcanoes are emplaced on the lava plateau at elevations of  metres ft above sea level and include maars tuff rings and scoria cones these various centres rise between  metres ft above the surrounding terrain nested craters breached craters and fissure vents are common among the various vents as are lava flows but there has been little research on the scoria cones lava flows embedded in valleys reach lengths of  kilometres mi pyroclastic cones in paliaike include aymond colorado dinero fell and negro the vent cerro del diablo a pyroclastic cone is the youngest volcano in the field and has emitted both a and pahoehoe lava which have a fresh appearance and no soil cover the vents were origins of lava flows which sometimes breached the vents some flows are older and covered with soil while younger ones are not such young lava flows also have surface features including lava tunnels hornitos tumuli and a wrinkled surface some of these are heavily eroded while the southeastern part of the field features freshlooking centres where they form the basaltos del diablo the individual volcanoes are subdivided into three groups which are referred to as u the plateau lavas u the older centres and u for the more recent vents geologic record maars are depressions in the ground which are encircled by a ring of sediment that rises above the surrounding terrain they typically form where frozen or liquid water interacts with rising magma and causes explosions in paliaike there are about  of them with diameters ranging from  metres ft to about  metres ft and they make up the characteristic topography of the volcanic field the periglacial ground is rich in ice and water which might explain why there are so many maars in paliaike notable among these lakes is laguna azul a crater lake which is located within a pyroclastic ring at the side of a scoria cone this maar formed during three stages in three separate craters and is also the source of a lava flow potrok aike in comparison is much larger crater diameter of  kilometres mi its rim is barely recognizable and appears to be more akin to a maar additional maars in the southwestern part of the field are the socalled west maar and east maar which contain the lakes laguna salsa and laguna del ruido respectively bismarck carlota los flamencos laguna salidalaguna ana and timone lake cause of volcanism a number of vents form various alignments usually along northwestsoutheast and eastnortheastwestsouthwest lines some older centres show a northsouth pattern such alignments occur when local lineations act as a pathway for magma to ascend to the crust and control not only the position of the vents but also the shape of the volcanoes forming on top of the vents these lines match the strike of the magallanesfagnano fault zone and the older patagonian austral rift faults within the field have been active in the tertiary and into the holocene and a graben in the southwestern part of the field has diverted lava flows eruptive history the gallegos river passes north of the volcanic field while its tributary rio chico crosses the volcanic field from southwest to northeast the terrain of the field is highly permeable to water which later forms wetlands that attract a number of birds and springs that are used as a source of water maars are not the only water bodies within the field lakes formed by lava dams glacial lakes and lakes formed by wind deflation also exist some of these water bodies dry up late in summer allowing wind to remove sediments from their lakebeds which thus become the origin of long dune fields active growth of such windstreaks has been observed in paliaike windstreaks are an uncommon occurrence on earth they are much more common on mars climate vegetation and fauna paliaike is part of the patagonian backarc a province of plateau lavas of cenozoic age these plateau lavas are of alkaline to tholeiitic composition hawaiite trachyandesite and trachyte are present in smaller amounts from south to north these plateau lavas include paliaike itself meseta vizcachas meseta de la muerte gran meseta central meseta buenos aires cerro pedrero meseta de somuncura pino hachado and buta ranquil their activity began million years ago when the chile ridge collided with the peruchile trench and thus caused a tear in the subducting slab and the formation of a slab window beneath patagonia another theory is that slab rollback might instead be the mechanism by which volcanism is triggered in the paliaike region the age trends of volcanism have been interpreted as indicating either a southward migration or a northeastward one in the case of the plateau lavas following the movement of the triple junction to the north in that case paliaike would be an exception probably due to local tectonic effects however some older plateau lavas in the north formed in response to an earlier ridge subduction event in the eocene and palaeocene archaeology and human history the actual andean volcanic arc is located  kilometres mi west of paliaike in the form of the austral volcanic zone a chain of stratovolcanoes and one volcanic field fueguino which is south americas southernmost volcano the camusu aike volcanic field dated at million years old is  kilometres mi northwest and the morro chico volcano about  kilometres mi west of paliaike see also at the southern end of south america the antarctic plate subducts beneath south america at a rate of  centimetres per year inyear in the peruchile trench this subduction process has caused adakitic volcanism on the western margin of southernmost south america forming the austral volcanic zone notes patagonia is a region where four tectonic plates the antarctic plate the nazca plate the scotia plate and the south america plate interact starting million years ago the chile ridge collided with the peruchile trench this collision originally occurred west of tierra del fuego but has since moved northward towards the taitao peninsula farther south the interaction between the scotia and south america plates gave rise to the deseado and magallanesfagnano faults references the paliaike volcanic field is mainly made up of alkali basalt and basanite which form a sodiumrich alkaline suite nephelinite has been reported and hawaiite is rare the most important phenocrystic phase is olivine which also appears as xenocrysts other minerals include clinopyroxene diopside and plagioclase the groundmass has a similar composition with the addition of augite feldspar and magnetite and occasionally ilmenite and nepheline paliaike rocks typically feature ultramafic xenoliths containing augite dunite eclogite garnet harzburgite lherzolite peridotite phlogopite pyroxenite spinel and wehrlites the composition of these xenoliths indicates that they originated from both the crust and the mantle in addition rocks from

explored in the s and named in  its origin remains unclear history in  raymond godivier and lucien le donche reported on a magnetic anomaly in the central african republic which they identified by analyzing their surface magnetic activity data of  these results were confirmed and built upon by the highaltitude aeromagnetic surveys carried out by the us naval oceanographic office as well as by the satellite measurements conducted in  with cosmos  and in the s with the orbiting geophysical observatory at  kilometres mi altitudes this data was combined in  and yielded a spatial map of  earths magnetic field which was then updated after the launch of the magsat satellite with an accuracy of nt at an altitude of  kilometres mi salient features in  robert d regan and bruce d marsh named the anomaly after the city located at its center origin the anomaly is sometimes called the bangui negative anomaly owing to its negative peaktotrough difference and is compared with the positive anomalies observed at the benue trough and congo basin where lower cambrian geological formations are exposed see also the bangui anomaly is bounded to the south by the walvis ridge the north by the cameroonst helena volcanic line and to the west by the midatlantic ridge it is shaped approximately as an ellipse km km mi mi in size it has three sections and the magnetic equator runs through its center it has a short axis diameter of about  kilometres mi and its amplitude varies between  nt at ground level and  nt at satellite altitude about  kilometres mi its features include a bouguer

account was ever set up and the kinney family missed  payments for over a year multiple communications were made between the kinney family and lenders during this period which questioned the lenders

jack schaefer published in  it was initially published in  in three parts in argosy magazine and originally titled rider from nowhere the novel has been printed in seventy or more editions and translated into over  languages and was adapted into the  film starring alan ladd plot the story is set in  wyoming whenthe wyoming territory was still open to the homestead act of  it is narrated by a homesteaders son bob starrett the original unclaimed land surrounding the starretts homestead had been used by a cattle driver named luke fletcher before being claimed by bobs father joe starrett along with  other homesteaders fletcher had settled there first although he could only claim  acres m as a homestead he wants to expand his herd homesteads in the area would hinder its growth characters the title character shane is a mysterious stranger who rides into and then out of the lives of the starrett family a man who seemed to come from nowhere and appeared equally determined to pass on to nowhere  he is typically quiet always silent about his past  he does not wear his gun and yet everyone seems to understand that he is a dangerous man  joe starrett hires shane as a hand on his farm and shane puts aside his handsome western clothes and buys dungarees he then helps the homesteaders to avoid intimidation by fletcher and his men who try to get them to abandon their farms with joe starretts leadership and shanes help the farmers resist fletcher shane is forced into a gun battle themes one of the most obvious themes of shane is the tension between the fencefavoring homesteaders and the openrange cattle man luke fletcher  in the book the homesteaders are shown as the smalltime operators threatened by a powerful wealthy man with a large herd of cattle and a government beef contract in later years author jack schaefer would regret this aspect of his novel that shane was aiding the advance of settlement giving his push to the accelerating onrush of the very civilization i find deserving contempt critical reception on a personal level the story deals with a mans attempt to leave behind a violent past and the decisions he must take when the homesteaders who have befriended him are faced with danger beyond their experience publication the story seen through the eyes of a young boy is also a coming of age story the boy is puzzled by shane and his hidden violence who is beyond his sheltered experience but comes to trust love and venerate him times book editor jack miles wrote that what makes shane different what makes it a classic among westerns is that it is a story told by a boy schaefer understoodthat the western is an american boys dream of the world as it should be argosy version shane also demonstrates schaefers strong focus on the social bonds between men as in the scene when shane and joe starrett uproot an old tree stump the section ends an old stump on its side with root ends making a strange pattern against the glow of the sun sinking behind the far mountains and two men looking over it into each others eyes houghton mifflin richard s wheeler has written of shane and its author this was jack schaefers first novel he preferred in later years to write stories less mythic and more attuned to the real west although he is little known and the volume of his work is small he surely ranks as one of this nations greatest the novel has frequently been honored by the western writers of america as one of the best of the modern genre film and tv adaptations marc simmons wrote by any standard of measurement jack schaefers shane rates as a classic in the literature of the american west william nauenberg wrote in the objective standard that shane by jack schaefer is an invigorating tale of heroism that celebrates the fundamental power of the good in human life and its ability to defeat evil influence shane was originally published by argosy an american pulp magazine it was published as rider from nowhere a threepart serial beginning in july   this version was also somewhat shorter most notably it did not include the famous early scene in which shane and joe starrett bond while working together to remove

in the manner of the baroque period of music the term includes original instruments which have survived unmodified since the baroque period as well as later instruments adjusted to the baroque setup and modern replicas baroque violins have become relatively common in recent decades thanks to historically informed performance with violinists returning to older models of instrument to achieve an authentic sound characteristics the differences between a baroque violin and a modern instrument include the size and nature of the neck fingerboard bridge bass bar and tailpiece baroque violins are almost always fitted with gut strings as opposed to the more common metal and synthetic strings on a modern instrument and played with a bow made on the baroque model rather than the modern tourte bow baroque violins are not fitted with a chin rest and are played without a shoulder rest bows the development of the violin started in the th century renaissance violins of this period are of a wide variety of sizes from small pochettes through descant treble and tenor instruments as a consort around  giovanni paolo cima wrote the first sonatas for violin marking the start of its use as a solo instrument the size and broad design of the violin became fairly consistent towards the start of the baroque period at about  in subsequent centuries there were a number of gradual changes to the violin and bow the main effect of these changes was to increase the overall sound and volume of the instrument to improve the instruments performance in higher registers and to enable longer legato phrases todays baroque violins are set up as far as possible in the manner of violins used from  to  technique and performance there was no single standard model of violin in the baroque period then as now instruments were made by individual craftsmen to different fashions the instruments used to play the work of claudio monteverdi at the very beginning of the baroque period differed somewhat from those of late baroque composers as a result a modern player who plays repertoire from throughout the baroque period but can afford only one instrument necessarily has to make a compromise with an instrument that has recognisably baroque characteristics but matches the instruments of any one part of the baroque imperfectly holding the instrument and lefthand technique the neck of a baroque violin can be at a shallower angle to the body of the instrument than is the case on a modern violin but again there was a great deal of variation the neck angle can result in less pressure being exerted on the bridge from the strings the old neck was also generally glued to the violins ribs and nailed from the inner topblock through the thicker more gently sloped neckheel while the modern neck is mortised into an opening cut into the ribs and upper edge of the violin the bridge in turn is shaped differently with less mass and greater flexibility in the upper half owing to the high placement of its eyesholes on either side vibrato the fingerboard on a baroque violin is also shorter than that on a modern violin during the baroque period the use of higher positions on the violin increased in  the highest note in regular use was the c above the estring while by  the a one octave above the estring was relatively common being for instance the highest note used in bachs violin music virtuoso violinists throughout the period continued to push the boundaries of possibility with locatelli reputedly playing in nd position bowing baroque violins are typically strung with gut e a and d strings and either a plain gut g or a metalwound gut g the guts in question are those of sheep wound into a material historically referred to as catline and occasionally if inaccurately referred to as catgut treatises baroque bows generally look straight or bent slightly outwards in the middle with an elegant swanbill pointed head they are typically made from strong heavy snakewood by contrast a modern bow is made from pernambuco and has a marked inwards bend particularly when the hair is relaxed and has a hatchet head at rightangles to the stick folk violins retaining characteristics of baroque violins bows underwent more changes within the baroque period than did violins bows of the earlier th century were used interchangeably between violins and viols they were particularly short and light and wellsuited for dance music italian music of the first half of the th century for instance the work of arcangelo corelli was played with a longer bow better suited to long singing notes it was in response to this continued desire for longer more legato playing that the inward curve was introduced in the mid thcentury and the modern bow derives from designs made by franois tourte in the later th century baroque violins today the screw mechanism for changing hair tension is first mentioned in a french shop inventory of  it was not universally accepted for over a decade as players were perfectly happy with clipin models a removable frog held in place by hair tension in a mortise carved into the stick its tension adjusted by shims between hair and frog surface

president of finland as such the president has the power of a delaying veto as a check against majority politics and potential violations of international agreements periods of cohabitation wherein the president and the government represent different political positions can create strife the presidents veto can be overridden by the parliament although this is in practice not done parties can

biologist meteorologist mathematician augustinian friar and abbot of st thomas abbey in brnn brno margraviate of moravia mendel was born in a germanspeaking family in the silesian part of the austrian empire todays czech republic and gained posthumous recognition as the founder of the modern science of genetics though farmers had known for millennia that crossbreeding of animals and plants could favor certain desirable traits mendels pea plant experiments conducted between  and  established many of the rules of heredity now referred to as the laws of mendelian inheritance academic career mendel worked with seven characteristics of pea plants plant height pod shape and color seed shape and color and flower position and color taking seed color as an example mendel showed that when a truebreeding yellow pea and a truebreeding green pea were crossbred their offspring always produced yellow seeds however in the next generation the green peas reappeared at a ratio of  green to  yellow to explain this phenomenon mendel coined the terms recessive and dominant in reference to certain traits in the preceding example the green trait which seems to have vanished in the first filial generation is recessive and the yellow is dominant he published his work in  demonstrating the actions of invisible factorsnow called genesin predictably determining the traits of an organism contributions the profound significance of mendels work was not recognized until the turn of the th century more than three decades later with the rediscovery of his laws erich von tschermak hugo de vries and carl correns independently verified several of mendels experimental findings in  ushering in the modern age of genetics experiments on plant hybridization mendel was born into a germanspeaking family in heinzendorf bei odrau now hynice czech republic at the moraviansilesian border austrian empire he was the son of anton and rosine schwirtlich mendel and had one older sister veronika and one younger theresia they lived and worked on a farm which had been owned by the mendel family for at least  years the house where mendel was born is now a museum devoted to mendel during his childhood mendel worked as a gardener and studied beekeeping as a young man he attended gymnasium in troppau now opava czech republic he had to take four months off during his gymnasium studies due to illness from  to  he studied practical and theoretical philosophy and physics at the philosophical institute of the university of olmtz now olomouc czech republic taking another year off because of illness he also struggled financially to pay for his studies and theresia gave him her dowry later he helped support her three sons two of whom became doctors initial reception of mendels work he became a monk in part because it enabled him to obtain an education without having to pay for it himself as the son of a struggling farmer the monastic life in his words spared him the perpetual anxiety about a means of livelihood born johann mendel he was given the name gregor eho in czech when he joined the order of saint augustine rediscovery of mendels work when mendel entered the faculty of philosophy the department of natural history and agriculture was headed by johann karl nestler who conducted extensive research of hereditary traits of plants and animals especially sheep upon recommendation of his physics teacher friedrich franz mendel entered the augustinian st thomass abbey in brnn now brno czech republic and began his training as a priest mendel worked as a substitute high school teacher in  he failed the oral part the last of three parts of his exams to become a certified high school teacher in  he was sent to the university of vienna to study under the sponsorship of abbot cyril frantiek napp so that he could get more formal education at vienna his professor of physics was christian doppler mendel returned to his abbey in  as a teacher principally of physics in  he took the exam to become a certified teacher and again failed the oral part in  he replaced napp as abbot of the monastery other experiments after he was elevated as abbot in  his scientific work largely ended as mendel became overburdened with administrative responsibilities especially a dispute with the civil government over its attempt to impose special taxes on religious institutions mendel died on  january  at the age of  in brnn moravia austriahungary now czech republic from chronic nephritis czech composer leo janek played the organ at his funeral after his death

in his genome was analysed revealing that mendel also suffered from heart problems mendelian paradox mendel known as the father of modern genetics chose to study variation in plants in his monasterys  hectares  acres experimental garden commemoration after initial experiments with pea plants mendel settled on studying seven traits that seemed to be inherited independently of other traits seed shape flower color seed coat tint pod shape unripe pod color flower location and plant height he first focused on seed shape which was either angular or round between  and  mendel cultivated and tested some  plants the majority of which were pea plants pisum sativum this study showed that when truebreeding different varieties were crossed to each other eg tall plants fertilized by short plants in the second generation one in four pea plants had purebred recessive traits two out of four were hybrids and one out of four were purebred dominant his experiments led him to make two generalizations the law of segregation and the law of independent assortment which later came to be known as mendels laws of inheritance see also mendel presented his paper versuche ber pflanzenhybriden experiments on plant hybridization at two meetings of the natural history society of brno in moravia on  february and  march  it generated a few favorable reports in local newspapers but was ignored by the scientific community when mendels paper was published in  in verhandlungen des naturforschenden vereines in brnn it was seen as essentially about hybridization rather than inheritance had little impact and was cited only  about three times over the next thirtyfive years his paper was criticized at the time but is now considered a seminal work notably charles darwin was not aware of mendels paper and it is envisaged that if he had been aware of it genetics as it exists now might have taken hold much earlier mendels scientific biography thus provides an example of the failure of obscure highly original innovators to receive the attention they deserve references about forty scientists listened to mendels two groundbreaking lectures but it would appear that they failed to understand his work later he also carried on a correspondence with carl ngeli one of the leading biologists of the time but ngeli too failed to appreciate mendels discoveries at times mendel must have entertained doubts about his work but not always my time will come he reportedly told a friend gustav von niessl further reading during mendels lifetime most biologists held the idea that all characteristics were passed to the next generation through blending inheritance in which the traits from each parent are averaged instances of this phenomenon are now explained by the action of multiple genes with quantitative effects charles darwin tried unsuccessfully to explain inheritance through a theory of pangenesis it was not until the early th century that the importance of mendels ideas was realized ext  a constitutional referendum was held in the republic of the congo on  march  the new constitution created a presidential republic with a bicameral parliament and a division of

limiting them to only official or otherwise reputable organizations centralized contact tracing the advent of covid contact tracing apps has led to concerns around privacy the rights of app users and governmental authority the european convention on human rights the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr and the united nations and the siracusa principles have outlined  principles to consider when looking at the ethical principles of mass surveillance with covid contact tracing apps these are necessity proportionality scientific validity and time boundedness decentralized contact tracing necessity is defined as the idea that governments should only interfere with a persons rights when deemed essential for public health interests the potential risks associated with infringements of personal privacy must be outweighed by the possibility of reducing significant harm to others potential benefits of contacttracing apps that may be considered include allowing for blanket populationlevel quarantine measures to be lifted sooner and the minimization of people under quarantine hence some contend that contacttracing apps are justified as they may be less intrusive than blanket quarantine measures furthermore the delay of an effective contacttracing app with significant health and economic benefits may be considered unethical development proportionality refers to the concept that a contact tracing apps potential negative impact on a persons rights should be justifiable by the severity of the health risks that are being addressed apps must use the most privacypreserving options available to achieve their goals and the selected option should not only be a logical option for achieving the goal but also an effective one methods scientific validity evaluates whether an app is effective timely and accurate traditional manual contacttracing procedures are not efficient enough for the covid pandemic and do not consider asymptomatic transmission contacttracing apps on the other hand can be effective covid contacttracing tools that could lead to a r value less than  and sustained epidemic suppression however for apps to be effective there needs to be a minimum  uptake in the population apps should be continually modified to reflect current knowledge on the diseases being monitored some argue that contacttracing apps should be considered societal experimental trials where results and adverse effects are evaluated according to the stringent guidelines of social experiments analyses should be conducted by independent research bodies and published for wide dissemination despite the current urgency of our pandemic situation we should still adhere to the standard rigors of scientific evaluation apple  google exposure notification protocol time boundedness describe the need for establishing legal and technical sunset clauses so that they are only allowed to operate as long as necessary to address the pandemic situation apps should be withdrawn as soon as possible after the end of the pandemic if the end of the pandemic cannot be predicted the use of apps should be regularly reviewed and

popular song about life in new york city during the s it was composed in  by vaudeville actor and singer charles b lawlor june    may   with lyrics by james w blake september    may   it was an immediate and longlasting hit and is often considered a theme for new york city many artists including mel torm duke ellington larry groce richard barone and the grateful dead have performed it governor al smith of new york used it as a theme song for his failed presidential campaigns of   and  the song is also known as east side west side from the first words of the chorus history the tune a slow and deliberate waltz was devised by lawlor he had been singing at charlie murphys anawanda democratic club for a ladies night with a good party on his walk home he thought to himself that he sang everyone elses tunes and he should write one of his own he couldnt think of anything on his long walk home but during the night the tune and theme came to him  from the walk itself the next day he went downtown to john goldens hat store where blake worked and hummed the melody for him the melody was very similar to an  song called daisy bell bicycle built for two by british composer harry dacre blake took a liking to the  tune and had lawlor repeat it several times you get the music on paper he told lawlor and ill write the words for it lawlor returned to the store in about twenty minutes with the musical notes written and blake was halfway through the lyrics having been interrupted by a customer he finished the words in another halfhour the tune and words became familiar and well known throughout new york city it was first made famous by lottie gilson and it had staying power because the melody was catchy and easy to sing lyrics the words were a shared vision of lawlor and blake and recall their childhood neighborhoods and those who grew up with them it was a universal longing for youth yesteryear and place although it was also idealized because both lawlor and blake had grown up quite poor lawlor said that he envisioned a big husky policeman leaning against a lamppost and twirling his club an organ grinder playing nearby and the east side kids with dirty faces shoes unlaced stockings down torn clothes dancing to the music while from a tenement window an old irish woman with a checkered cap and one of those old time checkered shawls around her shoulders looking down and smiling at the children the words of the song tell the story of blakes childhood including the friends all with irish surnames with whom he played as a child namely johnny casey jimmy crowe nellie shannon who danced the waltz and mamie orourke who taught blake how to trip the light fantastic  an extravagant expression for dancing the song is sung in nostalgic retrospect as blake and his childhood friends went their separate ways some leading to success while others did not some are up in g  others they are on the hog other commercial uses the song became popular right after it was published and governor al smith of new york was credited for its renaissance having used it as a theme song during his presidential campaigns of   and  during smiths  campaign the urbancentric tune proved symbolic of a campaign that failed to find its footing in americas more rural areas where herbert hoover was more popular   codification the united states statutes at large

extensions to html xhtml and various xmlbased document types for embedding rich metadata within web documents the resource description framework rdf datamodel mapping enables its use for embedding rdf subjectpredicateobject expressions within xhtml documents it also enables the extraction of rdf model triples by compliant user agents history the rdfa community runs a wiki website to host tools examples and tutorials versions and variants rdfa was first proposed by mark birbeck in the form of a wc note entitled xhtml and rdf which was then presented to the semantic web interest group at the wcs  technical plenary later that year the work became part of the sixth public working draft of xhtml although it is generally assumed that rdfa was originally intended only for xhtml  in fact the purpose of rdfa was always to provide a way to add a metadata to any xmlbased language indeed one of the earliest documents bearing the rdfa syntax name has the subtitle a collection of attributes for layering rdf on xml languages the document was written by mark birbeck and steven pemberton and was made available for discussion on october   htmlrdfa in april  the xhtml  working group produced a module to support rdf annotation within the xhtml  family  as an example it included an extended version of xhtml  dubbed xhtmlrdfa  although described as not representing an intended direction in terms of a formal markup language from the wc limited use of the xhtmlrdfa  dtd did subsequently appear on the public web rdfa  october  saw the first public working draft of a document entitled rdfa in xhtml syntax and processing  this superseded and expanded upon the april draft it contained rules for creating an rdfa parser as well as guidelines for organizations wishing to make practical use of the technology rdfa  in october  rdfa  reached recommendation status rdfa lite rdfa  reached recommendation status in june  it differs from rdfa  in that it no longer relies on the xmlspecific namespace mechanism therefore it is possible to use rdfa  with nonxml document types such as html  or html  details can be found in an appendix to html  essence an additional rdfa  primer document was last updated  march  the first public working draft dates back to  march  benefits there are some main welldefined variants of the basic concepts that are used as reference and as abbreviation to the wc standards usage rdfa was defined in  with the rdfa in xhtml syntax and processing recommendation its first application was to be a module of xhtml htmlrdfa statistics the html applications remained a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending xhtml to support rdf expanded to html are now expressed in a specialized standard the htmlrdfa the last is htmlrdfa   support for rdfa in html and html rdfa editors the htmlrdfa syntax of  was also termed rdfa  so there are no rdfa core  standardin general this s rdfa  is used with the old xhtml standards as long as rdfa  is used with

as follows html  rdfa  rdfa lite is minimal subset of rdfa  consisting of a few attributes that may be used to express machinereadable data in web documents like html svg and xml while it is not a

capital constructed extensive irrigation systems reorganised the countrys army reformed buddhist practices encouraged the arts and undertook military campaigns in south india and burma the adage not even a drop of water that comes from the rain must flow into the ocean without being made useful to man is one of his most famous utterances background in  parakramabahu following the death of his uncle kitti sri megha prince of dakkinadesa ascended the throne of dakkhinadesa over the next decade improved both dakkhinadesi infrastructure and military following a protracted civil war he secured power over the entire island around  and remained in this position until his death in  during parkramabhus reign he launched a punitive campaign against the kings of burma aided the pandyan dynasty against the chola dynasty in southern india and maintained extensive trade relations with china angkor and countries in the middle east within the island he consecrated religious monuments built hospitals social welfare units canals and large reservoirs such as the sea of parakrama early the island of sri lanka was disrupted by cholas following an invasion by raja raja chola i who took advantage from an internal strife and conquered nearly half of the island it was not until his successor the island was almost under chola control these regions remained under chola control until the reign of vijayabahu i  when vijayabahu i successfully drove the chola invaders out of the island he continued the capital at polonnaruwa rather than anuradhapura by the reign of vikramabhu i  the island was divided into three kingdomskingdom of rajarata kingdom of dakkhinadesa and kingdom of ruhuna vijayabahu i had given his sister mittas hand in marriage to a tamil pandyan prince and that pandyan prince would go on to become the father of manabharana who in turn was the father of parakramabahu i vikramabhu was however regarded as the greatest in dignity as he possessed rajarata with its sites of religious and historical importance however manabharana king of dakkhinadesa south country and his brothers sri vallabha and kitti sri megha the joint kings of ruhuna were formidable rivals for the crown furthermore all three were the descendants of vijayabahus sister and thus had a strong claim to the throne they are referred to in the culavamsa as the arya branch of the royal dynasty whilst vikramabhu i is of the kalinga branch birth at the time of parakramabahus birth the governor of dakkhinadesa manabharana been the eldest of the arya kings had two daughters mitta and phabavati and no sons he said youth we from the pure race of the moon  yet we three have been defeated by vikrama bahu  and yet there seem not any likelyhood of coming to us a son who would wipe off this stain in ruhuna and dakkhinadesa on the other hand his younger brother sri vallabha and his wife sugala had two children one of them being a son challenged the party of manabharana as per this he stepped down and passed his work to his ministers in rajarata the chronicle states further as parkramabhus birth was predicted by a figure akin to a god seen in a dream by his father king manabharana of dakkhinadesa a son was duly born to manabharanas wife ratnavali and was named parakramabahu though the year of his birth cannot be known exactly confirmed it is generally thought to be around  the location would almost certainly have been the capital of dakkhinadesa punkhagama return to dakkhinadesa upon being informed of the childs birth vikramabhu i in polonnaruwa ordered that the boy be brought up as the heir to his throne this kind of adoption may have been an olive branch of sorts on the part of vikramabhu who wished to keep the throne until his death after which it would be passed on to parkramabhu manabharana however rejected the offer stating that it is not prudent  to send away such a jewel of a son he also speculated that if the boy is taken thither the party of vikkamabahu will gleam with mighty upshooting flames but our misfortune alas so great will become still worse king of dakkhinadesa soon after the childs birth manabharana fell ill and died his younger brother kitti sri megha who was joint king of ruhuna ascended the throne of dakkhinadesa while sri vallabha was declared sole king of ruhuna parkramabhu his mother ratnavali and his two sisters mitta and pabhavati were sent to live in mahanagahula the capital of ruhuna under the care of manabharanas brother sri vallabha government and construction whilst he was still young his eldest sister mitta was forcibly married to their cousin manabharana the son of sri vallabha of ruhuna against the wishes of queen ratnavali ratnavali was herself of the kalinga clan of the royal family and though she was the widow of a king of the arya branch of the royal family she preferred to see her daughters married to a king from the kalinga clan during his time at sri vallabhas court parkramabhu met his future mahesi queen consort lilavati sri vallabhas daughter who went on to rule the country in her own right trade from dakkhinadesa in  following the death of vikramabhu his son gajabahu ii succeeded to the throne of rajarata two monarchs of the arya branch of the royal family sri vallabha and kitti sri megha tried unsuccessfully to seize rajarata by force preparation for war on the other hand parkramabhu impatient having only a minor state to rule left sri vallabhas palace in ruhuna and returned to dakkhinadesa where he took up residence with his uncle impatience is also to be attributed to sri vallabhas plans to place manabharana of ruhuna on the throne of rajarata which made parkramabhus position increasingly precarious in court in dakkhinadesa on the other hand he was well received by kitti sri megha who had no sons of his own where he was essentially adopted conquest of rajarata some time after his coming of age the young prince left dakkhinadesa in secrecy and set out for gajabahu iis realm in rajarata having met his allies at badalattha modern batalagoda he visited the senapati sankha on the border between rajarata and dakkhinadesa when sankha tried to inform kitti sri megha of the princes journey parkramabhu had him killed parkramabhu then seized buddhagama modern menikdena nuwara and all of sankhas property he continued his journey having evaded a force sent against him by kitti sri megha who feared complications with the court of polonnaruwa and traveled through the malaya region to gajabahus court war with gajabahu the reason provided for kitti sri meghas efforts to bring the prince back to dakkhinadesa are presented as nothing more than concern for the well being of his nephew as well as concerns that parkramabhu may reignite hostilities between the arya and kalinga factions however that the king of dakkhinadesa was tenderly attached to his nephew is regarded as fiction and it is pointed out that the spirit in which the accounts of these conflicts are conceived is irreconcilable with the theory of untroubled relations between uncle and nephew war with manabharana during his time in gajabahus court the parkramabhu did two things of significance the first was to enmesh the court of gajabahu in a web of espionage and the other was to marry one of his sisters called bhaddavati to king gajabahu through this marriage parkramabhu managed matters that gajabahu ii completely trusted him as much as he did the royal family nevertheless he retained the entirety of bhaddavatis dowry for himself the second was secretly negotiating with gajabahus general gokanna however gajabahu eventually grew suspicious of parkramabhus activities and aware parkramabhu departed rajarata in secrecy by night and returned to dakkhinadesa coronation and defeat of manabharana in dakkhinadesa  parkramabhu was reluctant to enter the capital sankhatthali to see his uncle king kitti sri megha until persuaded by his mother ratnavali to do so kitti sri megha however died soon after parkramabhus return and the culavamsa notes that the prince was not mastered by the agitation called forth by the grief at his fathers sic deathperhaps a sign of lingering ill feeling between the two parkramabhu was now king of dakkhinadesa reign parakramabahu was the sole king of dakkhinadesa by c  his objective for dakkhinadesa was to expand it so that it would surpass the greatness of other two kingdoms in a short period of time he formed an administration center called parakramapura solely for him the capital of parakramapura is identified with modern city panduwas nuwara economic policies and trade afterwards he started a huge program of construction and renovation of shrines and other structures the remnants of which can still be seen in north central province sri lanka today it is mentioned of him as having restored an ancient causeway called the kotabaddha over the deduru oya deduru lake near modern kurunegala the new kings personality was illustrated when the architects commissioned to the project informed him that it was wellnigh impossible to carry out to which parkramabhu replied that what is there in the world that cannot be carried out by people of energy he ordered the construction of canals and dams and cleared a large area of forest around them for new fields most notably he constructed the parakrama samudra a giant reservoir from which a large swathe of territory derived its water supply on islands in the middle of the reservoir he constructed a palace and a stupa religious reform trade was an important component of dakkhinadesas income since the island of sri lanka given its geographical position had always been at the junction of several major trade routes chinese silk was a significant import and was used in the consecration of statues and shrines pearls and gems of which the king took particular interest constituted an important part of the islands exports as did cinnamon which remained until the th century sri lankas major export and war elephants  most trade was carried out through the main seaports of the principality kalpitiya halaavatha chilaw and colombo construction parakramabahu decided to expand the region by entering the war which spanned for over a decade he first decided to reorganize the guards of dakkhinadesa kingdom  military campaigns parkramabhus army had a diverse ethnic makeup some of his officers were from the two grand old clans of sri lanka the moriya and the lambakanna who had between them dominated rajarata from anuradhapura under a man styling himself the king of malaya modern dumbara by the time hostilities broke out between dakkhinadesa and rajarata the formers forces also included veddas vellalar and people from the lower castes not traditionally involved in martial activities the culavamsa places the number of soldiers at somewhere around  people but the real figure was probably lower  parkramabhu would have been able to field war elephants cavalry and siege engines and his force represented a serious threat to gajabahus power in the north revolts around  parkramabhu made his first move by seizing control of malaya strategically securing his eastern flank he then moved his forces against various chieftains on the border of rajarata the final stage of this early campaign was the defeat of an army of gajabahu himself after which there was a brief ceasefire between the two sides war with bagan hostilities resumed soon afterwards gajabahu had resorted to securing support from abroad and by the time hostilities resumed between him and parkramabhu the army of rajarata included nobles of heretical faith from abroad parkramabhu himself did not participate in the invasion of rajarata but was responsible for the overall strategy of the campaign which was based on the writings of kautilya pandya war  the forces of dakkhinadesa struck at the fortress of mallavalana near the mouth of the kala oya seizing it and occupying the western coast of sri lanka the army then sailed up to the north and landed at a place called muttakara or mutukara pearlmine near modern mannar sri lanka in the meantime gajabahus senior general gokanna suffered several defeats in the vicinity of kala vewa and was forced to appeal to gajabahu in order to receive reinforcements despite receiving these and meeting with some success in malaya gokanna was again defeated by parkramabhus general mahinda a rout so total that gokanna fled the battle scene leaving behind his umbrella an important status symbol in medieval sri lanka the remnants of his force constructed a fortress in a jungle and took no further part in the war the retreating forces used horses with carriages to escape into the jungle with supplies in carriages death and legacy dakkhinadesi troops advanced through the amban river and advanced into bogambara afterwards defeated the heavily reinforced army and bodyguards of gajabahu and captured rajarata gajabahu was locked in the palace parakramabahu ordered the troops of the dakkhinadesa army to treat gajabahu with respect and not to pillage rajarata succession despite this some members of dakkhinadesi army are known to have disregarded his commands by breaking open house doors in rajarata and plundering goods and stole raiment and ornaments from the people of the city this pillaging was to have dire consequences for parkramabhu angered by the actions of the forces of dakkhinadesa gajabahu appealed to manabharana of ruhuna who was at sorabara in the center of the country for assistance legacy and issues parkramabhu sent his senapathi deva to restore order to polonnaruwa but he found himself in battle with manabharana of ruhuna before he could reorganize his troops the king of ruhuna kept to his word and delivered parkramabhus forces a crushing blow driving them from polonnaruwa for the kalinga clan however the alliance with manabharana of the arya clan backfired and it was soon made clear to gajabahu that manabharana intended to keep the city for himself he put to death many of gajabahus senior officials and imprisoned gajabahu letting him starve to death name gajabahu then appealed to parkramabhu for assistance by secretly sending a message and parkramabhu ordered his troops to cut off grain supplies by roaming around the towns of manabharana of ruhuna the troops blockaded the roads between ruhuna and polonnaruwa as a result all the people in the town with manabharana became weakened birds in a cage with the sporadic attacks from dakkhinadesa forces slowly grinding down his power in the north manabharana left polonnaruwa to attack a force commanded by rakkha that had been wreaking havoc in western rajarata in his absence parkramabhus forces seized polonnaruwa liberated gajabahu ii and took into their possession the entirety of the treasure of manabharana of ruhuna the king of ruhuna returned to his capital with the sacred relics the tooth relic and the alms bowls see also gajabahu who had been set free by parakramabahu left polonnaruwa before parkramabhu arrived and decided to leave the country by ship however an attack by some of gajabahus followers on parkramabhus troops reignited hostilities between the two and parkramabhu had to send his army to capture gajabahu by late  after suffering a number of defeats gajabahu realized his capture was imminent and appealed to the sangha to intervene  they persuaded parkramabhu that the ailing king no longer posed a threat and that he should be allowed to live out the rest of his days in peace manabharana tried to woo the king back to the battle against parkramabhu but gajabahu refused having the words i have made over rajarata to parkramabhu inscribed on a stone tablet sangamuwa inscription  to confirm his abdication in favor of parkramabhu gajabahu moved to gantale kantalai where he died in the nd year after his coronation as king of rajarata notes parkramabhu was immediately crowned king of rajarata but the war was far from over manabharana struck again sending his armies to the mahaweli river and attempting to cross into rajarata via two fords in the meantime narayana a chieftain based at anuradhapura rose in rebellion and parkramabhus hold in the north was again threatened references on this occasion parkramabhu decided to vanquish manabharana once and for all not even in rohana will i permit king manabharana who is here crushed in war to find a hold rakkha was commanded to hold the fords at the mahaweli while parkramabhu himself attacked from dakkhinadesa into ruhuna narayans rebellion was suppressed by another force leaving rakkha who had successfully held the fords at the mahaweli river free to invade from the north manabharana supported by some loyalist inhabitants defeated dakkhinadesan army and drove them back to rajarata parkramabhu found himself facing dissension within his own ranks and the defeat of his forces in malaya manabharana even recaptured polonnaruwa and advanced into giritale despite this parkramabhu persevered with the offensive withdrawing from his southern campaign and concentrating his forces in the north manabharana once again found himself besieged in polonnaruwa both sides were exhausted by the incessant warfare of the preceding years and manabharana eventually fled the city for ruhuna his forces were overtaken at the mahaweli river by parkramabhus army and annihilated the king returned to the south in time to pass away from a combination of disease and exhaustion further reading parkramabhu was finally the unquestioned lord of the entire island of sri lanka even though it had been at the cost of around five years of incessant warfare in years to come the king himself was to regard this war as one of the most significant events of his reign mentioning it in several of his edicts carved on stone such as the one near devangala he celebrated by summoning manabharanas son to polonnaruwa and concluding a peace with him followed by a lavish coronation ceremony ext   references briefings in functional genomics is a bimonthly peerreviewed scientific journal covering genomics

chaumire in paris in  he married ccile sabouraud a talented pianist and they had two sons laurent and mathieu born in  and  a third son thierry was born nine years later babar the babar books began as a bedtime story that ccile de brunhoff invented for their children mathieu and laurent when they were four and five years old respectively she was allegedly trying to comfort mathieu who was sick the boys liked the story of the little elephant who left the jungle for a city resembling paris so much that they asked their father a painter to illustrate it  he made it into a picture book with text which was published by a familyowned publishing house le jardin des modes originally it was planned that the books title page would describe the story as told by jean and ccile de brunhoff however she had her name omitted due to the role she played in the genesis of the babar story some sources refer to her as the creator of the babar story babar revived after the first book histoire de babar the

painting was different from his fathers and he emphasized picture more than text in the creation of his books he trained himself to draw elephants in strict accord with the style of his father consequently many people did not notice any difference in authorship and assumed the sixyear gap in the series was because of the war laurent has always been careful to emphasize that babar was his
